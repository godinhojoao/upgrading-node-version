## Introduction

- If you are here you already know that it's extremely important to have your dependencies always upgraded with the Long-term support (LTS) version.
- This guide provides step-by-step instructions to upgrade your Node.js version with a focus on security and stability. By following these steps, you can smoothly transition to a new Node.js version and adjust your code as needed.

## Why Should I Upgrade Node Version?

- Upgrading your Node.js version is crucial for `performance boosts`, `security updates`, `access to new features`, `compatibility` with the latest libraries, and `long-term support`. It ensures bug fixes, enhances stability, and keeps your project aligned with the active Node.js community and ecosystem.
- In summary, upgrading your Node.js version enhances cost-effectiveness, eases maintenance, and ensures reliability and security for your project.

## Step 1: Version Control

- Begin by implementing version control for your codebase using GIT. This is a crucial security measure as it provides a backup in case any complications arise during the upgrade process.
- It's essential to maintain version control throughout this process to ensure easy recovery in case of any issues.
  _Example_
  ```bash
  git init .
  git add .
  git commit -m 'message'
  git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
  git push origin main
  ```

## Step 2: Check Compatibility

- Choose the Node.js version you intend to migrate to and review its release notes. These notes provide insights into changes, deprecations, and new features introduced in the new version.
- Pay special attention to deprecations, as they will require adjustments in your code.
- You can do that reading the changelog of your desired version: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## Step 3: Update Node.js Version

- Utilize the Node Version Manager (NVM) to update your Node.js version. Install NVM, then proceed to install the desired Node.js version and set it as the active version:
  _Example_
  ```bash
    nvm install 20.10.0
    nvm use 20.10.0
  ```

## Step 4: Verify Outdated Dependencies Using CLI

- Run either `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` in your command line interface. These commands will display outdated packages within your codebase.
- The information provided includes the desired version and the latest version for each package.
- This step helps you assess whether the Node.js upgrade is worthwhile or, for smaller projects, if a rewrite might be more efficient.

## Step 5: Upgrade Outdated Dependencies

- Once you identify outdated dependencies, begin upgrading them individually within your package.json.
- Maintain version control while following these steps:
  1. Update the dependency in package.json.
  2. Run automated tests, if available.
  3. Manually test your code.
  4. Commit your progress to Git if all tests and manual checks pass.
- Repeat this process for all dependencies requiring updates.

## Step 6: Handle Deprecated APIs

- As mentioned in step 2, deprecated features in the new Node.js version need to be addressed. Replace these deprecated features with their more recent equivalents.
  _Example_

  ```js
  // Before Node.js 14
  const fs = require("fs");
  // Check if a file exists using deprecated fs.exists()
  fs.exists("/path/to/file", (exists) => {
    if (exists) {
      console.log("File exists!");
    } else {
      console.log("File does not exist.");
    }
  });

  // After Node.js 14
  const fsPromises = require("fs").promises;

  // Use the recommended fs.promises.access() method
  fsPromises
    .access("/path/to/file")
    .then(() => {
      console.log("File exists!");
    })
    .catch(() => {
      console.log("File does not exist.");
    });
  ```

## Step 7: Security Measures

### Test on QA Environments

- Running automated tests is crucial at this stage. Ensure you execute these tests to validate the changes made during the upgrade.
- Additionally, testing in an environment replicating your production setup is essential to verify overall functionality.

### Fallback Plan

- If your application is live in a production environment, establish tools for monitoring application logs.
  - `Sentry`, `Datadog`, and other similar solutions that provide comprehensive insights into your application's performance and error tracking.
- Develop a comprehensive rollback plan in case any issues appear after the upgrade.
- If you're utilizing a CI/CD pipeline, leverage its capabilities to facilitate quicker and more efficient rollback. It's advisable to create CI/CD pipelines for more fluid operations.

By meticulously following these steps, you can confidently upgrade your Node.js version, ensuring the stability, security, and performance of your application.

### Additional tips

- After completing all the steps, you can also check for any dependencies that are not in use.
  - Using the npm depcheck package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck
  - Running this command: `npx depcheck`
  - Update vulnerable dependencies: `npm audit`
